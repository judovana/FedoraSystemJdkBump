Hello fellow java package maintainers!

<TITLE>

Short Story:
 * if you have some java package, be aware that we are bumping JDK in rawhide
 * Ensure your package builds and runs fine with <JDK_TO> (see the <COPR_URL> )
 * there is special tooling ready for this, before mass rebuild is launched
 ** See <PROPOSAL_URL>#<PRELIMINARY_INFO>
 * If you do not want Fedora rotten with <JDK_FROM> for ever, continue reading

<LONG_STORY>

I would kindly ask you to search yourself in this list: <PEOPLE_LIST_URL>
If you are here, please check status of your package in <COPR_PLAIN> (pain text of <COPR_URL>). 
 * If all your packages are "succeeded",  congratulations nothing to do, and just keep en eye on JDK bump
 * If there is "failed" but contains "- 	-" then even srpm built failes. If you wish to resurrect it, please ensure it runs against <JDK_TO> (see lower)
 * If there is "failed" but failed in "seconds", then those packages failed so quickly, that the build was in initial phases. That usually mean that you build with source/target/release lower then <MIN_BYTECODE>. <JDK_TO> supports <MIN_BYTECODE> and up. We recommend to bump the source/target to <RECOMEND_BYTECODE>, to allow existence of compact <RECOMEND_BYTECODE> packages alongside main javastack. See <PROPOSAL_URL>#<WRONG_SOURCETARGETRELEASE>. Don't forget to upstream the patch, or maybe it is enough to update to more fresh upstream release which supports <JDK_TO>? it may happen, that after the fix, your build will fail in more terrible way (see below)
 * If there is "failed", and its none of above, then your package simply failed. Very often the scary error may be fixed by bump to latest upstream version. <JDK_TO> is out shortly, but changes against <JDK_FROM> are minimal, and upstreams keep an track. Please, try to fix the package. Don't hesitate to ask on devel@fedoraproject.org or java-devel@fedoraproject.org or directly to me <FROM_MAIL>. If you fix the fail, feel free to share your fix, it may help others. 
We are trying to gather the most common issues at <PROPOSAL_URL>#<COMMON_ISSUES> .  Feel free to enhance the page, or write us your case (possibly both with solution and without) so we can add it here.

If your package is  missing, and you wish it here, I will gladly add it! Just let me know - <FROM_MAIL>

<DEBUGGING>

Thank You!
  J.
