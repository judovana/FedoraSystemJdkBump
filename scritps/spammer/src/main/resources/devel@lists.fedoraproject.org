Hello fellow java package maintainers!

We are planning to bump the JDK from <JDK_FROM> to <JDK_TO> for <AFFECTED_FC>. Please see <PROPOSAL_URL>

Short Story:
 * if you have some java package, be aware that we are bumping JDK in rawhide
 * Ensure your package builds and runs fine with <JDK_TO> (see the <COPR_URL> )
 * there is special tooling ready for this, before mass rebuild is launched
 ** See <PROPOSAL_URL>#<PRELIMINARY_INFO>
 * If you do not want Fedora rotten with <JDK_FROM> for ever, continue reading

Long Story:
We ran a preliminary mass rebuild of javastack in copr repo  <COPR_URL> (select "all" instead of "25" at the bottom), on packages requiring java,javac, java-devel, maven-local, ant, ivy & comp. for build. You can see, the result was quite 	:
<TOTAL_ATTEMPT>  total; attempted to rebuild
<TOTAL_FAILED>  failed; from those <QUICK_FAIL> are trivial failures (but if you fix it, there is no guarantee real troubles are not hidden behind that)
<TOTAL_OK>  succeeded
<TOTAL_ERROR>  not even srpm rebuilt - orphan? dead? (but orpahns and dead ones should be already excluded)

I would kindly ask you to search yourself in this list: <PEOPLE_LIST_URL>
If you are here, please check status of your package in <COPR_PLAIN> (pain text of <COPR_URL>). 
 * If all your packages are "succeeded",  congratulations nothing to do, and just keep en eye on JDK bump
 * If there is "failed" but contains "- 	-" then even srpm built failes. If you wish to resurrect it, please ensure it runs against <JDK_TO> (see lower)
 * If there is "failed" but failed in "seconds", then those packages failed so quickly, that the build was in initial phases. That usually mean that you build with source/target/release lower then <MIN_BYTECODE>. <JDK_TO> supports <MIN_BYTECODE> and up. We recommend to bump the source/target to <RECOMEND_BYTECODE>, to allow existence of compact <RECOMEND_BYTECODE> packages alongside main javastack. See <PROPOSAL_URL>#<WRONG_SOURCETARGETRELEASE>. Don't forget to upstream the patch, or maybe it is enough to update to more fresh upstream release which supports <JDK_TO>? it may happen, that after the fix, your build will fail in more terrible way (see below)
 * If there is "failed", and its none of above, then your package simply failed. Very often the scary error may be fixed by bump to latest upstream version. <JDK_TO> is out shortly, but changes against <JDK_FROM> are minimal, and upstreams keep an track. Please, try to fix the package. Don't hesitate to ask on devel@fedoraproject.org or java-devel@fedoraproject.org or directly to me <FROM_MAIL>. If you fix the fail, feel free to share your fix, it may help others. 
We are trying to gather the most common issues at <PROPOSAL_URL>#<COMMON_ISSUES> .  Feel free to enhance the page, or write us your case (possibly both with solution and without) so we can add it here. 

Debugging Your failures.
The copr repo we maintain, contains builds of <JDK_TO> as system JDK, javapackages-tools, maven & comp. honoring that, and <JDK_FROM> as non system JDK. Also it contains successfully rebuilt packages. You can directly use this copr repo in several ways.
 * first glance on error. On <COPR_URL> find your build  (select "all" instead of "25" at the bottom),
 ** Click its number, select chroot (currently  <CHROOT> ) and check the logs. Main log is build.log.gz.
 * anything you push to rawhide, will automatically rebuild here in <CHROOT> chroot.
 ** It is the best approach. If you can fix your package in rawhide directly, without breaking the rawhide too much, go for it
 ** If yo need to experiment, I have a mock config for you (generated from  copr-cli mock-config <COPR_ID> <CHROOT>) which you can copy to your /etc/mock and use - <COPR_CFG> .  Eg:

 # as root, globally
 sudo wget <COPR_CFG_RAW> -O /etc/mock/<COPR_CHROOT>.cfg
 # or as user, locally (after creating  ~/.config/mock/)
 wget <COPR_CFG_RAW>  -O ~/.config/mock/<COPR_CHROOT>.cfg
 # change spec, bump sources, apply patches
 fedpkg srpm
 mock -r <COPR_CHROOT>  *.src.rpm

Or any other packaging workflow you use, and you can use against the copr repo.
Thank you very much for your help, there are <TOTAL_FAILED> failures, and <TOTAL_PACKAGERS> java packagers, but only 2 active members of java sig. Without your help, the JDK bump will be very hard.

Thank You!
  J.
