IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:dJN0nFWBcWK7SFs2k0nnsO+XNA9+aEDY4FWO7uhxTN8.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/jvanek/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /home/jvanek/.ssh/known_hosts:2
Password authentication is disabled to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
Keyboard-interactive authentication is disabled to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
UpdateHostkeys is disabled because the host key is not trusted.
